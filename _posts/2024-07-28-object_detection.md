## Install YOLOv8

‚ö†Ô∏è YOLOv8 is still under heavy development. Breaking changes are being introduced almost weekly. We strive to make our YOLOv8 notebooks work with the latest version of the library. Last tests took place on **27.01.2023** with version **YOLOv8.0.20**.

If you notice that our notebook behaves incorrectly - especially if you experience errors that prevent you from going through the tutorial - don't hesitate! Let us know and open an [issue](https://github.com/roboflow/notebooks/issues) on the Roboflow Notebooks repository.

YOLOv8 can be installed in two ways‚Ää-‚Ääfrom the source and via pip. This is because it is the first iteration of YOLO to have an official package.


```python
# Pip install method (recommended)

!pip install ultralytics==8.0.20

from IPython import display
display.clear_output()

import ultralytics
ultralytics.checks()
```


```python
# Git clone method (for development)

# %cd {HOME}
# !git clone github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics
# %cd {HOME}/ultralytics
# !pip install -qe ultralytics

# from IPython import display
# display.clear_output()

# import ultralytics
# ultralytics.checks()
```


```python
from ultralytics import YOLO

from IPython.display import display, Image
```

## CLI Basics

If you want to train, validate or run inference on models and don't need to make any modifications to the code, using YOLO command line interface is the easiest way to get started. Read more about CLI in [Ultralytics YOLO Docs](https://v8docs.ultralytics.com/cli/).

```
yolo task=detect    mode=train    model=yolov8n.yaml      args...
          classify       predict        yolov8n-cls.yaml  args...
          segment        val            yolov8n-seg.yaml  args...
                         export         yolov8n.pt        format=onnx  args...
```

## Inference with Pre-trained COCO Model

### üíª CLI

`yolo mode=predict` runs YOLOv8 inference on a variety of sources, downloading models automatically from the latest YOLOv8 release, and saving results to `runs/predict`.


```python
%cd {HOME}
!yolo task=detect mode=predict model=yolov8n.pt conf=0.25 source='https://media.roboflow.com/notebooks/examples/dog.jpeg' save=True
```


```python
from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/content/gdrive')
!ln -s /content/gdrive/My\ Drive/ /mydrive
!ls /mydrive


```


```python
from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/content/drive')
```


```python
!mkdir {HOME}/datasets
%cd {HOME}/datasets

!unzip /content/drive/MyDrive/freedomtech.zip
```

## Custom Training


```python
%cd {HOME}

!yolo task=detect mode=train model=yolov8n.pt data=/content/datasets/freedomtech/data.yaml epochs=70 imgsz=800 plots=True
```
